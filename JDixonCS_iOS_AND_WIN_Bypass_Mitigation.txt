! No matter the reasons that original author removed their repo's and OSS presence, even if it was ego or pride, they won't have any control over this reupload existing or not. I would never encourage anyone taking away their work from the community, instead, let the community decide if they'll keep using it, even if it gets outdated.

! Status: I do not possess the skills to update filter lists regularly, this is merely a reupload of what was purportedly lost forever due to original repo being deleted. Restored from OSINT backups. At least, the github raw link will work with your adblocker again.
